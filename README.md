SOC Monitoring Dashboard is a recruiter-friendly cybersecurity portfolio project built with Python, Flask, SQLite, ELK-ready log adapters. It provides a dashboard, REST API, persistence, tests, Docker support, and documentation that can be pushed as an individual GitHub repository.

## Features

- Log collection
- Threat detection
- Alert management
- Incident dashboard
- SQLite-backed result history
- REST API for analysis workflows
- Dashboard for recent findings
- CI workflow, issue templates, PR template, Dockerfile, and security notes

pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/app.py
~~~

Open http://localhost:5000.

## API Documentation

POST /api/analyze accepts a JSON body and returns a scored analysis result.

Example:

~~~bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/analyze -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{}"
~~~

GET /api/findings returns the latest stored analysis results.

GET /api/health returns service health.

## Testing Guide

~~~bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest -q
~~~

## Docker Deployment

~~~bash
docker compose up --build
~~~

## Screenshots

Add screenshots after running the dashboard:

- Dashboard overview
- API response sample
- Findings history

## Security Considerations

- Use only on assets you own or are explicitly authorized to assess.
- Do not commit secrets or API keys.
- Add authentication before public exposure.
- Review logs for sensitive data before sharing demonstrations.

## Professional Commit Examples

- feat: add scored analysis workflow
- test: cover service scoring output
- docs: add deployment and security notes
